was already something instilled in him, at home. Inspired by family members,
who were themselves fashion icons in Sri Lanka, Iraj understood the importance
of presentation. Given the much needed push by his father, Iraj took the leap to
follow his dreams. Beginning his career as a self-taught hair stylist, Iraj set off on

confident and beautiful. Whether you’re looking for a classic haircut, a bold new
color, or an intricate updo, he has the skills and creativity to bring your vision to
life. Iraj looks into the clients attitude, lifestyle and professional environment to
style the hair rather than just styling abruptly.
